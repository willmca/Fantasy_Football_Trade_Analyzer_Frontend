**Fantasy Football Trade Analyzer Front-End**

My Fantasy Football Trade Analyzer is a full-stack application that utilizes a front-end built in React and a back-end built with Express, Node, and Mongoose. As a Software Engineer and an avid fantasy football fan, this was the perfect project to combine my two passions. The application uses an algorithm I developed that converts FantasyPros' Rest of Season rankings into a player rating fom 0.05 to 15, and uses those player ratings to evaluate a trade.

**Build Status**

Due to other commitments I haven't been able to update the data weekly as I would like to, so it is currently out of date.

-Currently, I am manually updating player ratings each week. To keep things doable I am only using the top 300 players according to FantasyPros rankings and only updating ratings each week. I have plans to utilize a web scraper to help with the process of updating rankings which would result in more players being included in the player pool and more frequent updates.
